# Processes:


For Example: Imagine your computer is like a kitchen where you bake cookies. when you 
             decide to bake cookies, you `(the parent)` start gathering ingredients and 
             mixing them together. But then, you realize you need to help to shape the
             cookies and put them in the oven. So, you ask your little brother or sister
             `(the child)` to help you.


* `Parent Process`: This is like you in the kitchen. It the main program that starts 
                    running and does the initial work. For Example, when you open a
                    web browser on your computer, the web browser is the 
                    `parent process`.


* `Child Process`:  This is like your little brother or sister helping you in the 
                    kitchen. It's a new program that the parent process starts to help 
                    it do more specific tasks. For instance, when you click a link in 
                    your web browser and it opens a new tab, that new tab is a  
                    `child process` of the original web browser process.



So, in simple terms:

* Parent Process starts and does the main job.
* Child Process is started by the parent to help with specific tasks.

Just like in a kitchen, the parent (you) can have multiple helpers (child processes) to 
get things done faster and more efficiently in Linux.

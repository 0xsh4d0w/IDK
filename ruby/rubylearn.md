# Hello Ruby Program:

Now let's write a simple program of Ruby.

[+] **Requirements for Hello World Program**

* Download Ruby and install it.
* Create a file with `.rb` extensions.
* Connect ruby path to the file.
* Run the file.


#### Creating Hello Ruby Program:

1. use any text editor to creat a `main.rb` file. write the following 
   code:

```
puts "Hello, World!"
```  

2. Save, Run the file by following command:

```
ruby main.rb
```

> This is final output of our `Hello Ruby` Program.


# Ruby Operators:

Ruby has a built-in modern set of operators. `Operators` are a symbol 
which is used to perform different operations.

For example, +,-,`*`,/,etc.


[+] **Types of operators:**

* Unary operator.
* Arthimetic operator.
* Bitwise operator.
* Logical operator.
* Ternary operator.
* Assigment operator.
* Comparison operator.
* Range operator.


[+] **Unary Operator:**

> Unary operators expect a single operand to run on.

```
---------------------------------------------------
Operator 		| 		Description
---------------------------------------------------
! 				-> 		Boolean NOT
~				->  	Bitwise complement
+ 				-> 		Unary Plus 
```

**Example**

In file hello.rb, write the following code.

```
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

puts("Unary Operator")
puts(~5)
puts(~-5)
puts(!true)
puts(!false)
```


[+] **Arthimetic Operator:**

> Arthimetic operators take numerical values as operands and return them
  in a single value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator 		| 		Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
'+' 			-> 		Adds values from both sides of the operator.
'-'				->		Subtract values from both sides of the operator.
'*' 			->      Multiply values from both sides of the operator.
'/' 			-> 		Divide left side operand with the right side 
						operand.
'`**`'			-> 		Right side operand becomes the exponent of left 
						side operand.
'%'				-> 		Divide left side operand with right side operand
 				 		returning remainder.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Example**

```
```


[+] **Bitwise Operator**:
